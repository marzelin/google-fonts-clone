<p>
  This project shows how efficient react + redux can be and how easy it is
  to create complex user interfaces in these technologies. It renders
  hundreds of font cards that can be filtered with advanced search options
  in realtime. Go back to home page, hit search icon and see it in action.

  In addition you can see responsive behavior in adjusting user interface
  to device capabilities.
